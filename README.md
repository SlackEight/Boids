# Boids - your very own fish tank simulation! 🐟🐟
A unity implementation of boids! I added a shark too which, when near boids, causes the boids to change their cohesion and alignment values, causing them to disperse.

You can read about boids in [this paper by Craig W. Reynolds (1987).](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37402.37406)

Here's how the project looks in case you'd rather just see it ^^
